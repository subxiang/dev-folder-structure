dev-folder-structure
=========================

This project describes what a developer's folder should look alike, and can be used to scaffold the developer's folder.
A developer usually needs to keep source code for 3 types of projects:
1. serious source code written by himself
2. play work for testing out new ideas or technologies
3. other people's source code for study/reference/debug

Correspondingly a folder structure like the following can be used:
1. `awsome` for serious projects, possibly a future product
2. `play` for practices from tutorials/books, and ad-hoc testing of ideas
3. `reference` for projects made by others

Under each type, we categorize projects by subjects, e.g., win32, java, svg, etc.
Under each subject, we have the actual project folders. practices from books should be named as `book-<book name>`; practices from internet should be named as `site-<url>`.

All the projects are kept in github, with the type/subject as their topics(or tags).
